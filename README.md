# Layers

- [0] QWERTY base
- [1] LOWER: shifted symbols, fn, delete, volume keys
- [2] RAISE: numbers
- [3] VIM: vi-style navigation with hjkl, home/pgupdn/end
- [4] ADJUST: keyboard rgb, sound, midi

The only real differences from the default are no alternate alpha layouts and adding a navigation layer.
